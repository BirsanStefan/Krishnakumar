                        <p class="mainP">The redesign of the Uber Rider app on iOS and Android has had a positive impact on the pickup experience, at the time of writing (3 months since launch). However, contact rate has not been significantly decreased which means Riders
                            and Drivers continue to contact each other to confirm or coordinate pickup details. I believe this to be a behavior change that will reveal over a longer period of time.</p>
